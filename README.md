## Hello hello!

I'm JDSK0ala, but I also go by SKoala. Despite this, most people just get call me Koala. I'm just a guy (He/Him but idrc about what pronouns you use) who currently works on Minecraft related content, both Java Mods and Bedrock Addons

**My current (released) work is as follows:**

I contributed some animations to the mod [Dragon Mounts Remastered](https://modrinth.com/mod/dmr)

I co-own a group called the [Dragon Mounts Team](https://github.com/DragonMounts-Team)

**Work that I have in development (unreleased) are as follows:**

I am working on a Dragon Mounts 2 Bedrock Addon port of the [DM Teams continuation of Dragon Mounts 2](https://modrinth.com/mod/dragon-mounts-2)

I am creating my own solo mod. Currently, it's content remains a secret, but it will be avalible for Minecraft Java 1.21.1 on Forge, Fabric and NeoForge. A Bedrock Addon Port is in consideration, but whether I make one highly depends on how the recent addition of custom biomes will work


**You can find and follow me on:**

[My Discord Server](https://discord.gg/FbRxshQvnC). This is the place I am most active on, where you can get all the latest news on what I am doing. You can also chat to me here, or via DM's if you want

[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/JDSK0ala). I post downloads for my mods here

[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/jdsk0ala/projects), another place where I post downloads for my mods. I also post downloads for my bedrock addons here

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@JDSK0ala). While it currently consists of silly videos, I intend to use it more seriously later. My YouTube Posts will consist of some discord stuff, posted outside of discord

[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jdsk0ala.bsky.social). I intend to post some discord stuff on here, outside of discord

[Twitter](https://x.com/JDSK0ala)... Well ok, I don't know if I will be using that social at all lol. But I mean, I will list it here anyway, so you know it's officially my account

I also have a QQ Account. My username there is JDSK0ala and my account number is 3080968865

I also have other accounts listed in my discord, but the above are the ones your most likely to find useful


If you read this far, then thankyou. Hopefully there is more to come, sooner rather then later
