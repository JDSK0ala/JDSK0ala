## Hello hello!

I'm JDSK0ala, but I also go by SKoala. Despite this, most people just get call me Koala. I'm just a guy who currently works on Minecraft related content, both Java Mods and Bedrock Addons

## My current (released) work is as follows:

I contributed some animations to the mod [Dragon Mounts Remastered](https://modrinth.com/mod/dmr)

I co-own a group called the [Dragon Mounts Team](https://github.com/DragonMounts-Team), where I am working on a new dragon model and animations (Plus their implementation on DM2's Bedrock port)

## You can find and follow me on:

[My Discord Server](https://discord.gg/FbRxshQvnC). This is the place I am most active on, where you can get all the latest news on what I am doing. You can also chat to me here, or via DM's if you want

[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/JDSK0ala). I post downloads for my mods here

[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/jdsk0ala/projects), another place where I post downloads for my mods. I also post downloads for my bedrock addons here

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@JDSK0ala). While it currently consists of silly videos, I intend to use it more seriously later. My YouTube Posts will consist of some discord stuff, posted outside of discord

[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jdsk0ala.bsky.social). I intend to post some discord stuff on here, outside of discord

[Twitter](https://x.com/JDSK0ala)... Well ok, I don't know if I will be using that social at all lol. But I mean, I will list it here anyway, so you know it's officially my account

I also have a QQ Account. My username there is JDSK0ala and my account number is 3080968865

I also have other accounts listed in my discord, but the above are the ones your most likely to find useful

## Other info
If you read this far, then thankyou. Hopefully there is more to come, sooner rather then later
