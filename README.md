## Hello hello!

I'm JDSK0ala, but I also go by SKoala. Despite this, most people just get call me Koala. I'm just a guy who currently works on Minecraft related content, both Java Mods and Bedrock Addons

**My current (released) work is as follows:**
I contributed some animations to the mod [Dragon Mounts Remastered](https://modrinth.com/mod/dmr)
I co-own a group called the [Dragon Mounts Team](https://github.com/DragonMounts-Team)

**Work that I have in development (unreleased) are as follows:**
I am working on a Dragon Mounts 2 Bedrock Addon port of the [DM Teams continuation of Dragon Mounts 2](https://modrinth.com/mod/dragon-mounts-2)
I am creating my own solo mod. Currently, it's content remains a secret, but it will be avalible for Minecraft Java 1.21.1 on Forge, Fabric and NeoForge. A Bedrock Addon Port is in consideration, but whether I make one highly depends on how the recent addition of custom biomes will work
